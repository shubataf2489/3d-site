P = product. You made it. Be proud!

Example: Green Glass Door
MVP
Front-end
Webpage to collect input from the user
Webpage to display “yes, but a ___ can’t” or “no, but a ____ can”
Back-end
Use regex to test whether or not the word can go through the GGD
Use the Twinword API to find related words
Iterate through the words until an opposite example can be found
Beyond MVP
Use another API to make sure the opposite example is a noun
Automate notification of API limit to make sure I don’t exceed free quota
A multiple choice quizzer that will test the user’s knowledge of the solution



Approximate percentage of MVP completed: X%
Look at your completed tasks, relative to what you have left to finish
Example: 70%


Ok, here is where the training wheels come off.
You know when your MVP is due.
Look at your remaining tasks.
Look at a calendar.
Make a plan (feel free to change the format, i.e. a table)
Follow your plan. Modify as needed. But just make sure you finish the MVP by the deadline. Go!
